            <p>
                My name is Joshua Salvador and I am a Digital Futures undergraduate who currently studies in OCAD University. I am capable of getting along with peers, colleagues and handle the pressure of school and work at the same time. I grew up and studied in different countries and that is why I am capable of adjusting to various working conditions and get along with different people from different backgrounds. I am seeking an opportunity where I could make use of my skills, contribute to growth, gain experience and improve my technical competencies.
